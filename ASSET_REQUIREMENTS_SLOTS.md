# Slot Machine Asset Requirements (High-Roller Edition)

To attract high-value players ("whales"), the visual style must shift from "Web App" to **"Premium Vegas Casino"**.
The assets should look **expensive, glossy, and tactile**. Think: 3D rendered glass, gold metal, and internal lighting.

## 1. Art Style Direction
- **Style:** **Glossy 3D Rendered** or **High-Fidelity 2D**.
- **Lighting:** Internal glow (emissive), rim lighting, metallic reflections.
- **Palette:** Deep Purple, Gold, Cyan, Ruby Red.
- **Feel:** Heavy, valuable, satisfying.

## 2. Base Symbols (The Reels)
These must look like physical objects you want to touch.
