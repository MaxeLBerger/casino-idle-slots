# App Store & Marketing Asset Requirements (High-Roller Edition)

Your store presence must scream **"High Production Value"**. If it looks cheap, whales won't download it.

## 1. App Icon
**Goal:** Stand out against 1000 other slot games.
**Concept:** "The Golden Win".

- **Filename:** `app_icon_source.png` (1024x1024)
- **Visual:**
    - Background: Deep, rich black or dark purple radial gradient.
    - Center: A massive, realistic **Gold "7"** or **Diamond**.
    - Effect: A bright lens flare hitting the corner of the object.
    - No text. The symbol represents the genre.

## 2. Feature Graphic (Google Play)
**Goal:** Convey excitement and wealth.

- **Filename:** `feature_graphic.png` (1024x500)

    - Left side: The Game Logo (Gold 3D Text: "CASINO IDLE SLOTS").

    - Background: Dynamic motion blur, suggesting speed and action.

Use a "Phone Frame" mockup for all screenshots. Add short, punchy text above the phone.
