# UI & Icon Asset Requirements (High-Roller Edition)

The UI must feel like a luxury dashboard. Avoid "flat" design. Go for **Glassmorphism** (frosted glass) with **Gold Borders**.

## 1. Primary Action Button (The "Spin" Button)
This is the most important element. It must feel physical.

- **`btn_spin_idle.webp`**: A large, circular or rounded-rect button. Green or Gold. Looks like a physical arcade button with a glossy plastic cap.
- **`btn_spin_pressed.webp`**: The same button, but slightly darker and shifted down (to simulate being pressed).

## 2. Currency & Resources
These icons represent the player's wealth. They must look valuable.

| Icon | Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🪙 | `icon_coin.webp` | **Gold Casino Chip**. A high-denomination casino chip (black/gold) with the game logo or a "$" in the center. |
| 🏆 | `icon_prestige.webp` | **Diamond Trophy**. A trophy made entirely of crystal/diamond. Represents high-level achievement. |
| ⭐ | `icon_xp.webp` | **Experience Badge**. A shield or badge shape (police/sheriff style) in silver/blue. |
| ⚡ | `icon_energy.webp` | **Voltage Bolt**. A 3D lightning bolt, glowing blue/white, looking like pure energy. |

## 3. Category Icons (Achievements/Leaderboard)
Replace the generic emojis with stylized 3D icons.

| Category | Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spins | `icon_cat_spins.webp` | A miniature 3D slot machine handle/lever. |
| Wins | `icon_cat_wins.webp` | A stack of cash wads wrapped in gold bands. |
| Earnings | `icon_cat_earnings.webp` | A bank vault door, slightly open. |
| Upgrades | `icon_cat_upgrades.webp` | A microchip or a "Level Up" arrow made of green neon glass. |
| Prestige | `icon_cat_prestige.webp` | A royal scepter or the Diamond Trophy (reused). |
| Special | `icon_cat_special.webp` | A mystery chest, glowing from the crack. |

## 4. Backgrounds & Panels
The atmosphere of the casino.

- **`bg_main.webp`**: **"VIP Lounge"**. A dark, out-of-focus background. Deep purples and blacks. Maybe subtle bokeh lights in the distance (like distant slot machines). *Crucial: Must not be distracting.*
- **`panel_glass.webp`**: A 9-slice image (or CSS equivalent) for dialogs. Dark semi-transparent black glass with a thin **Gold Border**.
